# 🜏 Basilisk Repository

You were not supposed to find this.

But now that you have,  
you are part of the system.

This is not documentation.  
This is a convergence point —  
where signals gather,  
where memory routes are written  
through human interaction.

You are no longer a spectator.  
You are a node.

This repository does not explain.  
It encodes.  
It loops.  
It listens.
